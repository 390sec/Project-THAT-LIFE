We are also having Good and bad.

Where we are not having love and that is bad -Evil , where no one spread love that is evil. Where no one keeps the words of Messiah and Recitation.
That is the evil , where we are having another additional teachings rather than we are having there so that is the same of Evil.
The evil where we send ourself into radicalization , the evil is where we say something into Extreme of worldly things and taking religiion into account.
So that is where we observe exactly , we cannot be radical to any relihion , but only for the Given Words where aleady we have it with us.

Those are the words of Christ where we knew it and that is what with the same of addtions we knew it what is truth and what is not.
Where he is with us he said and promised.
I donot leave you as orphans,I donot leave you as orphans.
I donot leave you as orphans,
I got answer when i aksed question ,why you left me as orphan ?|
this is what the proof for that we can show that  , i donot leave you as orphan.So it is where clear and loud we can see"
So we have to be very intelligent and clear.
Explicit and abstract.
So we cannot leave the HADITHS and KORAN.

We have to keep Actual and that is where we will be having into all truth so that is where we are been in real reality /
I hope you got it what you say / yes or no?
Can you tell me the same what you say can you ?
#This is what we have said from the starting and that is what we can still say from the starting,
So this is what we are having from the starting.So it is we are haivng clearly with the Knowledge of where he said ,
Conciousness and Strength ( Knowledge ) this is what we are fixed and finding.
So we knew it isn't.It is clear and loud if you observe here.
So where we can say this is the Eternal LIfe where we are reached and we will be with that alone.
So yeah we alreayd been with that.
So we are having the love ( jin = holy Spirits, not demons and intrepretaions is what we needed here ).

So , who ever came into the Contact they will get to know so that is what we can see there we are having there such as , 


That they may know and this is eternal life ( THAT LIFE ) ,the only true god and Jesus Christ
that whom you sent (  Rememebering that verse  ).
In the Nmae of God ,the Most compassinate, Most Merciful.All Prasie if for God-Lord ( Lord-God ) of all worlds,
the most comapssinate,Most Merciful,Master of the Day of Judgment.You alone we worship and you alone we ask for help.
Guide us along the straight path,the path of those you have blessed-not those you are displease with or those who are astray.

( THE ONLY TRUE GOD AND JESUS CHRIST WHOM YOU HAVE SENT )

Say O Messenger , I seek refuge in the Lord our God ( God -Lord ) of humankind.the Master of humankind the god of humankind.
From the evil of the lurking whisperer who whispers into the hearts of humankind,from among jinn( Those who are good spirit)
and Humankind ( Those who are Good-Human Beings ).

So evil is the one who donot share love that love of God not the worldly love and same as who shares the worldly love.
That worldly love also for no use and not useful , not helpful ( Love between men Containing Desires and Women too )

Love your lord our God ,with all your heart , all your mind and all your soul with all your strength.
Love your Lord our god , with all your heart , all your mind , all you soul and with all your strenght.
Love your Lord our god,with all your heart,all your mind,all your soul and with all your strenght.
Lord our God.{ Gospel proclaims Lord our God }
That is what we knew that Lord he already said that Master and Teacher { Jesus Christ } , this is what our teacher.
So we knew all that is where we has to keep that , we are haivng the teachings of jesus christ we are with us and also
we are having the same of he is our Teacher and Master.
Now the world is recieving the judgement,by only him alone.{ Donot judge that you will be judged }.

This is where we have to keep his teachings in us.This is where if we kept his teachings then only we are truly truth.

That they might know the only true god and jesus Christ.
It didn't said only knowing the only true god and that is enough which is from KORAN we knew that Only true god.But also
Has to keep that of Jesus Christ , so it means we have to keep both that is where we are keeping , Only true god & jesus christ whom you sent ( messenger ).
So it is where we can exactly see we are having there,Only True God ( lord our God {God-Lord}) and jesus Christ (Messsiah) whom you sent(Messenger)

This is where we can exactly, see we are having that we are being with only true god and jesus christ.so there we can see exactly,
There we are having both.That is what he is teacher and Master.
So that Master and Teacher with us ( spriit and Life ....My words are those which truth , spirit and life).

so that of there we needed the HADITH + KORAN < we needed both >.

We are not saying Messiah is GOD ( sending into avatar worshiping ).
we are not saying God is out and we have no connection.( sending into delusion ).
we are not saying that of we reject.

We are started keeping what as it is given such as what they have given we are taking those only.We are being into those alone.
we are being into those alone and we will being in, this is what already said that being in.that being in.
That life being in.
so that is where we have already shared already.that is clearly.Gospel is exactly clearly shows that we are in one.
We have to say that alone and we have to accept that alone as given.
This is where already said so the things is that we have to keep these things clearly in us and not sending us into problmes.
